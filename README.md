# Neural-Networks-2

## Employee Attrition & Department Prediction Model
This project is focused on developing a neural network model to predict employee attrition and department allocation using TensorFlow and scikit-learn. 

## Processing
* Determining unique values for categorical variables
* Encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
* Scaling features with StandardScaler

## Compilation/Training
The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and trained using categorical and binary cross-entropy losses for department and attrition predictions. 
Model accuracy is monitored for both outputs.

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and accuracy for both predictions is reported.
